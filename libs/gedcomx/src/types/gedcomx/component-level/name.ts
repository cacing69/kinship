/**
 * The "Name" Data Type
 * https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#name-conclusion
 *
 * The Name data type defines a name of a person.
 *
 * A Name is intended to represent a single variant of a person's name.
 * This means that nicknames, spelling variations, or other names (often distinguishable by a name type)
 * should be modeled with separate instances of Name.
 *
 * The name forms of a name contain alternate representations of the name.
 * A Name MUST contain at least one name form, presumably a representation of the name that is
 * considered proper and well formed in the person's native, historical cultural context. Other name forms MAY be included, which can be used to represent this name in contexts where the native name form is not easily recognized and interpreted. Alternate forms are more likely in situations where conclusions are being analyzed across cultural context boundaries that have both language and writing script differences.
 *
 * For example, a Korean name has a native Korean form, but can also have a Chinese form and a Roman/Latin
 * formâ€”three different name forms, but each representing the same name.
 *
 * If more than one name form is provided, included name forms are presumed to be given in order of preference,
 * with the most preferred name form in the first position in the list.
