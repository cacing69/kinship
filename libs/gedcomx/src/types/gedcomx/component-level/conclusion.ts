/**
 * The "Conclusion" Data Type
 * https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#conclusion
 *
 * The Conclusion data type defines the abstract concept for a basic genealogical data item.

 * In formal discussions of the genealogical research process, the term "conclusion"
 * usually has a more specific meaning and is used to refer to an "accepted" hypothesis in accordance
 * with the Genealogical Proof Standard. The name of the Conclusion data type is not meant
 * to be associated with the definition of the term "conclusion" as it is described in the genealogical research process.
 *
 * Rather, the name refers to the notion that any information that is interpreted from an "original"
 * is in some way a "conclusion"â€”even if the interpreter was diligent
 * in representing the information verbatim as it was found in the original.
